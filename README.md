# sheet2tab

My project to try to read sheet music and generate guitar and ukulele tabs from it.

So far if I can turn music into my format, I can output guitar/ukuele tabs.

I can also transform guitar tabs into ukulele tabs (with minor errors if the notes do not exist on ukuleles).

The main problem right now is with actually reading sheet music.
